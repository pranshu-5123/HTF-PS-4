Problem Statement 4: Empowering Elderly Care with multi agent AI system

Challenge Overview:

As the global population ages, ensuring the well-being of elderly individuals living independently presents a major challenge.
The goal of this hackathon is to develop a multi-agentic Al system that assists elderly individuals by providing real-time monitoring, reminders, and safety
alerts, while promoting health management and social engagement. The agents will work together to create a collaborative support system, involving
caregivers, healthcare providers, and family members to ensure optimal care and peace of mind.
The system should monitor health, detect unusual behavior, and provide alerts in case of emergencies. It should also provide reminders to manage daily
routines, such as medication schedules, appointments, and daily activities.

Current Process:

Healthcare Provider: Monitors health data (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels) through wearable devices and gets alerted if abnormal values
are detected.

Safety Monitoring System: Uses sensors or wearables to track movement, activity, and falls. If an elderly person falls or exhibits unusual behavior (e.g.,
remaining stationary for too long), the system triggers an alert.

Daily activity Reminder System: Sends reminders in form of voice notes to the elderly individual for medication intake, scheduled appointments or daily
activities.

Expected Technical Output: Multiagent framework
